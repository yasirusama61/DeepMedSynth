# 🏥 DeepMedSynth - Synthetic Medical Image Generator

DeepMedSynth is a **GAN-based deep learning project** designed to generate **synthetic medical images** (X-rays, MRIs) for research and AI model training. The goal is to enhance dataset availability while ensuring **data privacy and security**.

##  Features
✅ Generate synthetic **X-ray** and **MRI** images using GANs  
✅ Support for **DCGAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN** architectures  
✅ Open-source and privacy-preserving AI-generated medical images  
✅ Preprocessing pipeline for dataset preparation  
✅ Model training and evaluation with visualization
