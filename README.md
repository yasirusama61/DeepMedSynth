# üè• DeepMedSynth - Synthetic Medical Image Generator

DeepMedSynth is a **GAN-based deep learning project** designed to generate **synthetic medical images** (X-rays, MRIs) for research and AI model training. The goal is to enhance dataset availability while ensuring **data privacy and security**.

##  Features
‚úÖ Generate synthetic **X-ray** and **MRI** images using GANs  
‚úÖ Support for **DCGAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN** architectures  
‚úÖ Open-source and privacy-preserving AI-generated medical images  
‚úÖ Preprocessing pipeline for dataset preparation  
‚úÖ Model training and evaluation with visualization

## üß† BraTS2020 Dataset

The **Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS2020)** dataset is used in this project to train GAN-based models for generating synthetic brain MRI images with tumor labels. It serves as a standard benchmark in the field of medical image synthesis and segmentation.

### üìÅ Dataset Location
```
   DeepMedSynth/data/BraTS2020/`
```

### üì¶ Contents

Each case contains five volumes:

- `FLAIR`: Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery
- `T1w`: T1-weighted image
- `T1CE`: Post-contrast T1-weighted image
- `T2w`: T2-weighted image
- `seg`: Ground truth segmentation mask

Each volume is in **NIfTI (.nii.gz)** format.

### üß™ Modalities Shape

All MRI volumes are preprocessed to:

- Shape: **240 √ó 240 √ó 155**
- Aligned to the same anatomical space
- Intensity-normalized per modality

### üè∑Ô∏è Segmentation Mask Labels

- `0`: Background  
- `1`: Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NCR/NET)  
- `2`: Peritumoral Edema (ED)  
- `4`: Enhancing Tumor (ET)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The dataset is stored locally and not included in this repository due to size and privacy restrictions.  
You can download the dataset from the official [BraTS 2020 Challenge page](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2020/data.html).
